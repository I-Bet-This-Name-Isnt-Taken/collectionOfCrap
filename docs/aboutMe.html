            <p>
                Hi! My name is Elliott Weigand I am a mechanical engineering student at Penn State Behrend. I like to spend most of my time wrapped up in the world of agriculture. I enjoy managing the cattle at my farm, making sure they are comfortable and happy. I keep the fencing and equipment maintained and in operating order. When I am not on my farm, I am at my friendsâ€™ farm making sure their dairy heard is well taken care of. Farming is in my blood, and I hope to keep mine and their farms alive for generations to come. The world needs to eat, and we need to feed them.

            <h3><strong>Reflective Essay...</strong></h3>
            <p>
                For the creation of this website using the HTML language, the hardest part was trying to get the code to do exactly what you want it to do. For instance, sizing photos in the gallery or getting the ccs file to read to your other files properly. The advantage of building the website this way is you get a real understanding of how HTML works. You can also share the code for the website very easily. The challenge to editing the format of a website using HTML is that there is a lot of saving and reloading the page to make sure what you are doing within the code is what you really want. A lot of trial and error is involved. You must be knowledgeable about how certain attributes work together. I believe with more practice and knowledge I could better refine this website.
