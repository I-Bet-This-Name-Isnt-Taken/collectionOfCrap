Using declassified documents from U.S., British, and other archives, Chris Tudda shows how the Cold War developed from an ideological struggle between capitalism and communism into a truly global struggle. From Potsdam in 1945, to Malta in 1989, the nuclear superpowers met to determine how to end World War II, manage the arms race, and ultimately, end the Cold War. Meanwhile, the newly independent nations of the 'Third World, ' including the People's Republic of China, became active and respected members of the international community determined to manage their own fates independent of the superpowers. The six summits--Potsdam (1945), Bandung (1955), Glassboro (1967), Beijing (1972), Vienna (1972), and Malta (1989)--are here examined together in a single volume for the first time. An introductory essay provides a historiographical analysis of Cold War summitry, while the conclusion ties the summits together and demonstrates how the history of the Cold War can be understood not only by examining the meetings between the superpowers, but also by analyzing how the developing nations became agents of change and thus affected international relations""--From publisher's website","2015","2025-03-24 16:29:10","2025-03-24 16:40:11","","","225","","","","","Cold War summits","New approaches to international history","","","","Bloomsbury Academic, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc","London, UK","","","","","","Library Catalog (Blacklight)","D842 .T83 2015","OCLC: 897016287","","","https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/16212377","Physical","Cold War; World politics; 1945-1989; 1900 - 1999; 20th century; Cold War (1945-1989); Diplomacy; History; International relations; Summit meetings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was also about conflicting worldviews & their correlates in the daily life of the societies involved. The term 'Cold War Culture' is often used in a broad sense to describe media influences, social practices, & symbolic representations as they shape, & are shaped by, international relations. Yet, it remains in question whether the Cold War Culture model can be applied to European societies, both in the East & the West. While every European country had to adapt to the constraints imposed by the Cold War, individual development was affected by specific conditions as detailed in these chapters.
